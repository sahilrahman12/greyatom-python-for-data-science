Performed the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on a loan dataset using various Python libraries such as "Pandas", "Numpy" and "MatplotLib". I have done a Loan Approval Analysis to whom to provide the loan and whom not to, based on the various affecting factors such as "Gender", "Marital Status", "Sel-Employment". Then, I have analysed the percentage of loan approved based on a person's employment type and the number of applicants having loan amount term greater than or equal to 25 years and finally analysed the average income of an applicant and the average loan given to a person based on their income.
